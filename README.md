# TableView-Rounded-Cells-example

This is an experiment which creates a table view with cells that have rounded corners. The cells change width to fit their 
content. There are a few other ideas in here also. 

* Setting the background color of cells based on index. 
* Using NSNumberFormatter spellout style to sepll out number names. 
* layer.cornerRadius
